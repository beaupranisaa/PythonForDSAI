    "- Modify this file to be Final-<Your FirstName-[First Letter of Last Name]>, e.g., <code>Final-Chaklam-S.ipynb</code>\n",
    "- This exam accounts for 45% of the overall course assessment.\n",
    "- This exam is open-booked; open-internet.\n",
    "- You ARE NOT allowed to use sklearn or pytorch libraries, unless stated.\n",
    "- The completed exams shall be submitted at the Google Classroom\n",

    "\n",
    "## Examination Rules:\n",
    "- For **offline** students, you may leave the room temporarily with the approval and supervision of the proctors. No extra time will be added to the exam in such cases.\n",
    "- For **online** students, you are required to turn on your webcam during the entire period of the exam time\n",
    "- Students will be allowed to leave at the **earliest 45 minutes** after the exam has started\n",
    "- **All work should belong to you**.  A student should NOT engage in the following activities which proctors reserve the right to interpret any of such act as academic dishonesty without questioning:\n",
    "    - Chatting with any human beings physically or via online methods\n",
    "    - Plagiarism of any sort, i.e., copying from internet sources or friends.  **Both copee and copier shall be given a minimum penalty of zero mark for that particular question or the whole exam.**\n",

    "\n",
    "                        x = 13 --fc--> 7 --fc--> 3 --fc--> 7 --fc--> 13 = x'\n",
    "    \n",
    "Here fc stands for fully connected / dense layer.  I shall leave the activation, momentum, dropout, learning rate, epochs, number of layers and other parameters as open-ended for you to try out.  For those who don't quite understand what is this neural network does, it is simply squeezing 13 features (the original x) into 7 then to 3.  The left half is called the encoder.  Then from 3, it attempts to reconstruct to 7 and then to 13 (the reconstructed x').  The right half is called the decoder.  Thus the neural network is simply a dimensionality reduction machine. Note that we are NOT working on variational autoencoder in which the encoder splits out mu and sigma, and hence become a generative model.\n",

    "c). Define the loss function as the reconstruction loss, which is simply the the MSE (5pts)\n",

    "\n",
    "d). Execute the model, and print out the reconstruction loss.  Make sure they become smaller!  Also make sure to optimize the parameters (2pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "e). Perform predictions and compare (2pts):\n",
    "   - Using the output from a forward pass (see below) on the encoder (NOT the decoder) to predict y\n",
